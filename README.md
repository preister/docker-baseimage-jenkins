# docker-jenkins

Sets up a baseimage (https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)  container with jenkins installed listening on port 8080.

## Usage

Currently in pre-alpha, if you know how to use it feel free to give it a try - if you don't you should better wait until later on.

## Building

To build the image, simply invoke

    docker build github.com/preister/docker-jenkins

Currently there are no prebuild containers available - as well as no additional functionality added ;)
